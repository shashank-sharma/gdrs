## Introduction

### Technologies Used

1. Django Rest Framework with PostgreSQL as Backend
2. Angular 5 as frontend and deployed on Heroku. Later planning to use AWS S3 for hosting static files
3. Android app with firebase with real time database

### How to test ?

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd frontend` - To switch to Angular code
3. `npm install` - To install all the dependencies
4. `npm run start` - To start the server (We use ng eject to get webpack services for deployment)

### What about backend ?

Our backend server is live and accepting all the calls (DRF based server). Code can be viewed from root folder by accessing their respective apps.

### What next ?

Our code is on development and not live means it is still in development so there are missing code pieces which needs to be integrated.
